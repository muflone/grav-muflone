# Description

**gpTrace** is a free GTK+ application to trace the activities of an external process. You just need only to select an external application to launch, click on the **Execute** button and view the results. Every syscall (call to a operating system function) will be shown and every external process will be traced in the gpTrace window.

It's also possible to select which syscalls to intercept to include or exclude in order to limit the results.
